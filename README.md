### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register_business`: Register a new business
- `POST /auth/login_business`: Log in a business and get a JWT token
- `GET /auth/me`: Get current business details (protected)

### Loyalty Management
- `POST /businesses/{business_id}/loyalty_rules`: Set or update the loyalty rate for a business
- `POST /transactions/add_points`: Add points for a customer

## Demo Business Account

For testing purposes, you can register a new business account using the registration form.

## Notes

- The SMS functionality is currently a placeholder. In a production environment, it would integrate with Twilio or another SMS service.
- For the MVP, authentication tokens are stored in localStorage. In a production environment, a more secure approach would be implemented.
- CORS is currently configured to allow all origins. In a production environment, this would be restricted to specific domains.
