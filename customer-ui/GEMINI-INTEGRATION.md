## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Frontend (JavaScript) ‚Üí Customer UI Server (Express) ‚Üí Gemini API
                                 ‚Üì
                        Backend API (FastAPI)
```

### API Endpoints

#### Chat Endpoint
- **URL**: `POST /api/chat`
- **Body**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "How many points do I have?",
    "sessionId": "session_123"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "response": "AI assistant response",
    "sessionId": "session_123"
  }
  ```

#### Configuration Endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /api/config`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "geminiEnabled": true,
    "backendUrl": "http://localhost:8000"
  }
  ```

### Session Management

The system maintains conversation context using session IDs:
- Each user gets a unique session ID
- Conversation history is stored per session
- History is limited to last 10 messages for memory efficiency

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Never expose your Gemini API key in client-side code
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for chat requests
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Custom Prompts

You can customize the AI's behavior by modifying the system prompt in `gemini-assistant.js`:

```javascript
getSystemPrompt() {
    return `You are a helpful and friendly loyalty program assistant...`;
}
```

### Adding New Tools

To add new tools:

1. Define the tool in `getTools()` method
2. Implement the tool logic in `executeTool()` method
3. Add response formatting in `formatToolResponse()` method

### Example: Adding a Store Locator Tool

```javascript
// In getTools()
{
    name: 'find_stores',
    description: 'Find nearby participating stores',
    parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
            location: {
                type: 'string',
                description: 'User location (city, zipcode, etc.)'
            }
        },
        required: ['location']
    }
}

// In executeTool()
case 'find_stores':
    return await this.findStores(parameters.location);
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Chat Analytics
- Track conversation patterns
- Monitor tool usage
- Analyze user satisfaction
- Identify common queries

### Performance Metrics
- Response time
- API usage
- Error rates
- User engagement

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"AI not using tools to get real data"**
   - Check server logs for tool usage messages (look for "Using check_points tool...")
   - Ensure phone numbers are in the correct format (+1234567890)
   - Verify the backend API is running and accessible
   - Test with: "How many points do I have for +1234567890?"

2. **"Gemini API key not found"**
   - Check your `.env` file has `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
   - Ensure the API key is valid (test at Google AI Studio)
   - Restart the server after adding the key

3. **"Headers is not defined" error**
   - Ensure node-fetch is installed: `npm install node-fetch`
   - Check that the polyfills are loaded in server.js
   - Update to a compatible Node.js version if needed

4. **"Chat not working"**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify backend API is running on port 8000
   - Check network connectivity

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable detailed logging** - Check server console for:
   ```
   üì• Chat request: "How many points do I have?"
   Using check_points tool for phone: +1234567890
   üì§ Chat response: Success
   ```

2. **Test AI assistant directly**:
   ```bash
   node test-ai.js
   ```

3. **Test API endpoints manually**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5500/api/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "How many points do I have for +1234567890?", "sessionId": "test"}'
   ```

4. **Verify tool responses**:
   - Check if backend API responds: `curl http://localhost:8000/customers/points/+1234567890`
   - Look for tool usage in server logs
   - Ensure phone number format is recognized

### Tool Usage Verification

To verify tools are working:

1. **Points Check**: Send "How many points do I have for +1234567890?"
   - Should see: "Using check_points tool for phone: +1234567890" in logs
   - Response should include real data like "üìä You have **X points**!"

2. **Recommendations**: Send "Any recommendations for +1234567890?"
   - Should see: "Using get_recommendations tool for phone: +1234567890" in logs
   - Response should include personalized suggestions

3. **Referrals**: Send "How do referrals work?"
   - Should see: "Using explain_referrals tool" in logs
   - Response should include detailed referral information

## üé® Customization

### UI Customization
- Modify chat widget styles in `index.html`
- Update colors and themes
- Add custom animations

### Response Formatting
- Customize message formatting in `formatToolResponse()`
- Add emoji and styling

## üö¢ Deployment

### Environment Variables
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
BACKEND_API_URL=https://your-backend.com
PORT=5500
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Production Considerations
- Use environment-specific configuration
- Implement proper logging
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Configure HTTPS
- Set up load balancing

## üìà Future Enhancements
