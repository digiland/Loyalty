## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd customer-ui
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   Or for development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the UI**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Make sure your FastAPI backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`

## API Integration

The customer UI integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- `GET /customers/points/{phone_number}` - Get customer points and transactions
- `GET /customers/recommendations/{phone_number}` - Get personalized recommendations

## Configuration

### API URL
Update the `apiUrl` in `app.js` to match your backend URL:
```javascript
this.apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8000'; // Update as needed
```

### Styling
The UI uses Tailwind CSS via CDN. Custom styles are defined in the `<style>` section of `index.html`.

## File Structure

```
customer-ui/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file with UI structure
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js             # JavaScript application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js          # Express server for serving static files
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Node.js dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # This file
```

## Browser Support

## Development

### Adding New Chat Features
To add new chat capabilities:

1. Update the `processLLMQuery` method in `app.js`
2. Add new query handlers following the existing pattern
3. Test with various natural language inputs

### Customizing the UI
- Colors: Modify the gradient classes in `index.html`
- Layout: Update the grid structure and responsive classes
- Animations: Adjust the CSS animations in the `<style>` section

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Chat not working**: Check console for JavaScript errors

3. **Styling issues**: Ensure Tailwind CSS CDN is loading properly

### API Errors
