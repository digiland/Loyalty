## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Server Logs
When you send a message, you should see logs like:
```
📥 Chat request: "How many points do I have for +1234567890?"
Using check_points tool for phone: +1234567890
📤 Chat response: Success

```

### 2. Verify Tool Usage
- **Points queries** should trigger `check_points` tool
- **Recommendation requests** should trigger `get_recommendations` tool
- **Referral questions** should trigger `explain_referrals` tool

### 3. Check Response Format
Successful tool responses should include:
- 📊 Emoji indicators
- **Bold formatting** for important numbers
- Structured information layout
- Personalized, contextual responses

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Issue: "AI gives generic responses"
**Solution**: 
- Check if Gemini API key is configured
- Verify backend API is running on port 8000
- Look for tool usage in server logs

### Issue: "Headers is not defined"
**Solution**:
```bash
npm install node-fetch
# Restart server
```

### Issue: "No tool usage in logs"
**Solution**:
- Ensure phone numbers are in format: +1234567890
- Use explicit queries like "check points for +1234567890"
- Verify message processing logic

### Issue: "Customer not found"
**Solution**:
- Add test data through admin interface
- Use backend API to create test customers
- Check if backend database has customer records

## 📊 Expected AI Behavior

### ✅ Good AI Response (Using Tools)
```
User: "How many points do I have for +1234567890?"

AI: "📊 You have **1,250 points**! 🎉 Great job earning rewards! 

📝 Recent Activity:
• Coffee Shop: +50 points (Dec 15, 2024)
• Restaurant: +100 points (Dec 12, 2024)
• Bakery: -75 points (Dec 10, 2024)

Would you like to see what rewards you can redeem?"

### ❌ Bad AI Response (Generic)
```
User: "How many points do I have?"

AI: "I'd like to help you check your points balance! However, as an AI assistant, I don't have direct access to your personal account information..."
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

4. **Formatted**: Responses use emojis and structured formatting
5. **Interactive**: AI can handle follow-up questions about the same data

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add More Tools**: Implement business locator, offer finder, etc.
2. **Enhance Prompts**: Customize AI personality for your brand
3. **Add Analytics**: Track most common queries and tool usage
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add production-ready safeguards
5. **Voice Integration**: Add speech-to-text for voice queries
